# 2048_using_python

This is the classical 2048 game that I built using Python - Tkinter.

To start the game, run python 2048.py
The game looks something like this ->
<img src = "Screenshot/2048.png" width = "500px">

Logic.py : Contains all the logic behind the game. 

Constant.py : Contains all the constants that are being used in the UI while building the game with tkinter.

2048.py : Contains the UI details and the 2048 game class which is inherited from Frame class.

All the files have relevant comments for complete detailed explanation.
